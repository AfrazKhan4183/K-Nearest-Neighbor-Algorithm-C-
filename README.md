# K-Nearest-Neighbor-Algorithm-C-
This is a K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm made with C++, You can enter some input tuples to find the max closest results evaluated from that Algorithm.

Finals Results shown will be collected from the Data-Set given by user in databases from which you want to retrieve data.
